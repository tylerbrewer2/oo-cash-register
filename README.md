# Object Oriented Cash Register

## Description

We're going to create an Object Oriented Cash Register that can add items of varying
quantities and prices, calculate discounts, and keep track of what's been added to it.

## Instructions

Follow along with the specs in `spec/cash_register_spec.rb`. They have been set to
`--fail-fast`, so by completing one test at a time, you'll end up with a relatively
complex class at the end.

Take it one step at a time!

## Bonus

Build a method called `void_last_transaction` that will remove the last transaction from the total. You'll need to make an additional attribute accessor and keep track of that last transaction amount somehow. Hint: in what method of the class are you working with an individual item?
